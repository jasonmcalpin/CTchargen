# World Generation Documentation

This document explains how the CTchargen world generation system works and how to use it.

## Overview

The world generation system in CTchargen creates random worlds for the Classic Traveller role-playing game. Each world has characteristics such as size, atmosphere, hydrographics, population, government, law level, and tech level, which are combined to form a Universal World Profile (UWP).

## Universal World Profile (UWP)

The Universal World Profile (UWP) is a string of characters that represents the characteristics of a world. Each character represents a different characteristic, and the characters are arranged in a specific order:

```
SATHPGL
```

Where:
- S: Size (0-10)
- A: Atmosphere (0-15)
- T: Temperature (0-15, not used in CTchargen)
- H: Hydrographics (0-10)
- P: Population (0-15)
- G: Government (0-15)
- L: Law Level (0-15)

Additionally, worlds have a starport class (A, B, C, D, E, or X) and a tech level (0-15).

## World Generation Process

The world generation process follows these steps:

1. Generate a starport class
2. Generate a size
3. Calculate atmosphere based on size
4. Calculate hydrographics based on size and atmosphere
5. Generate population
6. Calculate government based on population
7. Calculate law level based on government and population
8. Calculate tech level based on various factors
9. Determine trade classifications based on world characteristics

## Using the World Generator

### Python API

You can use the world generator programmatically:

```python
from src.lib.worldgen import generate_world

# Generate a random world
world = generate_world()
print(world)

# Generate multiple worlds
from src.lib.worldgen import generate_worlds
worlds = generate_worlds(5)
for world in worlds:
    print(world)
```

## World Characteristics

### Starport

The starport class represents the quality of the starport facilities on the world:

- A: Excellent quality starport

- 10: 100% water (water world)

### Population

- 5: Hundreds of thousands
- 6: Millions
- 7: Tens of millions
- 8: Hundreds of millions

- 10: Charismatic Dictator
- 11: Non-Charismatic Leader
- 12: Charismatic Oligarchy
- 13: Religious Dictatorship
- 14: Religious Autocracy

### Law Level

The restrictiveness of the world's laws, from 0 (no restrictions) to 15 (extreme restrictions):

- 0: No restrictions
- 1-9: Progressively more restrictive
- 10-15: Extreme restrictions

### Tech Level

The technological development of the world, from 0 (primitive) to 15 (extremely advanced):

- 0: Primitive (stone age)
- 1: Bronze age
- 2: Iron age
- 3: Medieval
- 4: Renaissance
- 5: Industrial revolution
- 6: Nuclear age
- 7: Early stellar
- 8: Pre-stellar
- 9: Early stellar
- 10: Early stellar

## Trade Classifications

Worlds can have one or more trade classifications based on their characteristics:

- Ag: Agricultural
- As: Asteroid
- Ba: Barren
- De: Desert
- Fl: Fluid Oceans
- Ga: Garden
- Hi: High Population
- Ht: High Technology
- Ic: Ice-Capped
- In: Industrial
- Lo: Low Population
- Lt: Low Technology
- Na: Non-Agricultural
- Ni: Non-Industrial
- Po: Poor
- Ri: Rich
- Va: Vacuum
- Wa: Water World

## Examples

Here are some examples of worlds generated by the system:

```
UPP: 7106956
Starport: C
Size: 7
Atmosphere: 1
Hydrographics: 0
Population: 6
Government: 9
Law Level: 5
Tech Level: 6
Trade Classifications: Na Va
```

```
UPP: 91281074
Starport: B
Size: 9
Atmosphere: 1
Hydrographics: 2
Population: 8
Government: 10
Law Level: 7
Tech Level: 4
Trade Classifications: Na Hi
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with world generation:

1. Check that the world generation parameters are valid
2. Verify that the trade classification rules are correctly implemented
3. Ensure that the random number generator is working correctly
4. Check the console output for error messages

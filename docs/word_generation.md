# Word Generation Documentation

This document explains how the CTchargen word generation system works and how to use it.

## Overview

The word generation system in CTchargen creates random words based on syllable patterns. It's primarily used for generating character names, but can also be used for creating other types of words.

## How It Works

The word generator works by:

1. Determining the number of syllables for the word
2. Creating a pattern of syllable components (vowels, consonants)
3. Replacing each component with a random letter or letter combination
4. Combining the components to form a word

## Syllable Components

The word generator uses the following syllable components:

- `v`: Single vowel (a, e, i, o, u)
- `vv`: Voiced vowel (ay, ee, oo, etc.)
- `c`: Voiceless consonant (f, k, p, s, t, etc.)
- `cc`: Voiced consonant (b, d, g, j, l, m, n, etc.)

## Syllable Patterns

Syllable patterns are defined in the `syllable_starter.json` file. Each pattern is a list of syllable components. For example:

- `['v']`: A single vowel
- `['c', 'v']`: A consonant followed by a vowel
- `['v', 'c']`: A vowel followed by a consonant
- `['c', 'v', 'c']`: A consonant, a vowel, and a consonant

## Using the Word Generator

### Command Line Interface

You can use the word generator directly from the command line:

```
python -m src.lib.wordplay
```

This will generate a random word.

### Python API

You can also use the word generator programmatically:

```python
from src.lib.wordplay import create_word

# Generate a random word
word = create_word()
print(word)

# Generate a word with a specific seed
word = create_word(seed="myseed")
print(word)
```

## Customizing Word Generation

### Syllable Rules

You can customize the word generation by modifying the `syllable_starter.json` file. This file contains the rules for generating syllables.

The file has the following structure:

```json
{
  "syllable_length": [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4],
  "syllable_size_list": [0, 1, 2],
  "vowels": ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"],
  "voiced_vowels": ["ay", "ee", "oo", ...],
  "voiced_consonants": ["b", "d", "g", ...],
  "voiceless_consonants": ["f", "k", "p", ...],
  "syllable_styles": [
    [["v"], ["c"]],
    [["c", "v"], ["v", "c"], ...],
    [["c", "v", "c"], ...]
  ]
}
```

- `syllable_length`: Possible number of syllables in a word
- `syllable_size_list`: Indices into the `syllable_styles` array
- `vowels`: List of single vowels
- `voiced_vowels`: List of voiced vowels (dipthongs)
- `voiced_consonants`: List of voiced consonants
- `voiceless_consonants`: List of voiceless consonants
- `syllable_styles`: Array of arrays of syllable patterns

### Custom Syllable Rules

You can create custom syllable rules by creating a new JSON file with the same structure as `syllable_starter.json` and specifying it in the configuration:

```json
{
  "name_generation": {
    "data_file": "path/to/my_syllable_rules.json"
  }
}
```

## Advanced Usage

### Generating Names with Specific Characteristics

You can use the word generator to create names with specific characteristics by customizing the syllable rules. For example:

- For fantasy names, you might want to use more voiced vowels and consonants
- For sci-fi names, you might want to use more unusual letter combinations
- For specific cultures, you might want to use letter combinations common in that culture

### Integrating with Other Systems

The word generator can be integrated with other systems, such as:

- Character generation systems
- World generation systems
- NPC generation systems

## Examples

Here are some examples of words generated by the system:

- "Ith"
- "Uchou"
- "Ootoa"
- "Ei"
- "Zhodani"
- "Aslan"
- "Vargr"

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with word generation:

1. Check that the `syllable_starter.json` file is valid JSON
2. Verify that the syllable rules are correctly formatted
3. Ensure that the file is in the correct location
4. Check the console output for error messages

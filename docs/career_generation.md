# Career Generation System

This document explains the career generation system in CTchargen.

## Overview

The career generation system creates realistic Classic Traveller characters with careers, ranks, skills, equipment, and cash. The system is designed to be flexible and extensible, allowing for easy addition of new careers and customization of existing ones.

## Career Data Structure

Each career is defined in the `CAREERS` dictionary in `src/careers.py`. The dictionary has the following structure:

```python
CAREERS = {
    "Career Name": {
        "ranks": [
            "Rank 1",
            "Rank 2",
            # ...
        ],
        "skills": [
            "Skill 1",
            "Skill 2",
            # ...
        ],
        "weapons": [
            "Weapon 1",
            "Weapon 2",
            # ...
        ],
        "equipment": [
            "Equipment 1",
            "Equipment 2",
            # ...
        ],
        "cash_table": [amount1, amount2, ...]
    },
    # More careers...
}
```

### Career Fields

- `ranks`: List of rank titles in order of progression. The index in this list corresponds to the rank level.
- `skills`: List of skills available to this career. Characters will randomly select skills from this list based on their terms served.
- `weapons`: List of weapons available to this career. Characters may be assigned 0-2 weapons from this list.
- `equipment`: List of equipment available to this career. Characters will be assigned 1-3 equipment items from this list.

2. **Terms Determination**: The character serves 1-4 terms in their career.
3. **Rank Determination**: The character's rank is determined based on their career and terms served.
4. **Skill Acquisition**: The character acquires 1-2 skills per term served, selected from their career's skill list.
5. **Equipment Assignment**: The character is assigned weapons, armor, and equipment based on their career.
6. **Cash Determination**: The character's starting cash is determined based on their career and terms served.

## Functions

The career generation system includes the following functions:

- `generate_career()`: Selects a random career from the available careers.
- `generate_rank(career, terms)`: Determines the character's rank based on their career and terms served.
- `generate_skills(career, terms)`: Assigns skills to the character based on their career and terms served.
- `generate_equipment(career)`: Assigns weapons, armor, and equipment to the character based on their career.
- `generate_cash(career, terms)`: Determines the character's starting cash based on their career and terms served.

## Extending the System

To add a new career to the system:

1. Add a new entry to the `CAREERS` dictionary in `src/careers.py`.
2. Define the career's ranks, skills, weapons, equipment, and cash table.
3. Ensure the career generation functions work with your new career.

Example:

```python
CAREERS["Diplomat"] = {
    "ranks": [
        "Attach√©",
        "Third Secretary",
        "Second Secretary",
        "First Secretary",
        "Counselor",
        "Minister",
        "Ambassador"
    ],
    "skills": [
        "Admin",
        "Liaison",
        "Linguistics",
        "Streetwise",
        "Carousing",
        "Bribery",
        "Leadership",
        "Computer",
        "Legal"
    ],
    "weapons": [
        "Pistol",
        "Stunner"
    ],
    "equipment": [
        "Communicator",
        "Diplomatic ID",
        "Formal Attire",
        "Portable Computer"
    ],
    "cash_table": [2000, 5000, 10000, 20000, 30000, 50000, 100000]
}
```

## Integration with Character Generation

The career generation system is integrated with the character generation system in `src/character.py`. The `Character` class includes a method `_generate_career_and_skills()` that uses the career generation functions to create a complete character with a career, skills, equipment, and cash.

## Output

The career information is included in the character output, both in the console preview and in the generated files. The templates in the `templates/` directory have been updated to include the career information.

Example output:
